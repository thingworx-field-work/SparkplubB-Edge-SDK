# SparkplugB-Edge-SDK
A ThingWorx Java Edge SDK component for integrating ThingWorx with Unified Namespace / SparkplugB architectures.

# Overview
This is a field-developed ThingWorx edge SDK agent for integrating to a Unified Namespace (UNS) architecture using MQTT and SparkplugB technologies.

This is not core PTC product developed by PTC R&D and must be treated as a field customisation.

The intent is for ThingWorx to integrate to UNS architectures both as an Industrial IIoT application development environment to consume from the UNS, and as a node to contribute new data to the UNS (e.g. OEE metrics).

The extension has been developed using the ThingWorx Java Edge SDK and Eclipse MQTT / SparkplugB libraries for encoding / decoding SparkplugB messages.
